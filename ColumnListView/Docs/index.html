<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A ColumnListView displays a list of items that can be structured
either in a linear list or an outline form with items grouped under
other items. The levels of the outline are indicated by successive
levels of indentation.</P>

SRC="pics/Hierarchical.jpg" WIDTH=368 HEIGHT=245 X-SAS-UseImageWidth
X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P>

<P>The items in the list are themselves composed of entries arranged
in columns. The ColumnListView displays a bar containing the column
headings. The user may drag the columns to reorder or resize them,
and those user actions affect all item entries in the column. The
user can click on a column heading to select that column to be used
as the key for sorting, for example by name,by size, by date.
Furthermore, if the user holds shift and clicks another column, the
column can be made a "secondary sorting key." Thus, items could be
sorted by type, with name set as the secondary sorting key so that
the items will be grouped by type, then within each type group, the
items will be alphabetized. Any number of secondary sorting columns
can be selected, with each column being added at a lower priority
than the preceding column.</P>

item class to automate display of text and graphics in columns,
automate string truncation of item contents to fit the column width,
and automate sorting of text columns.  In most cases, this is the
class that you should use because it will save a lot of work.</P>

<P><HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="Usage"></A>Usage</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The main class is
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>.
This class contains the content area (i.e. the list itself, not
including scroll bars or the column headers). It is derived from
BListView and behaves much like a BListView or BOutlineListView.
Constructing a
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B> also
constructs a container BScrollView and returns it indirectly via the
<I>containerView</I> argument. The BScrollView contains the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>,
scrollbars and border if requested, and the column header view. It is
this container view that should be added to your view hierarchy.
Automatic deletion of the container view and
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>
automatically through destruction of a parent BView or BWindow works
fine, but if you remove the ColumnListView from a view hierarchy, you
should delete the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>, not
the container BView. Technically, you could delete the container view
and that would delete the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>, but
it makes for cleaner code to delete the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>,
since that's what new returned.</P>

<P>Columns are added to the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B> via
the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html#AddColumn()">AddColumn()</A></TT></B>
function. Columns are represented by the
<B><TT><A HREF="CLVColumn.html">CLVColumn</A></TT></B> class. They
are added once and generally left there, and are thereafter
identified by the ordinal position in which they were added to the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>.
Columns can be shown or hidden (without having to remove) them using
the
<B><TT><A HREF="CLVColumn.html#SetShown()">SetShown()</A></TT></B>
function. This is convenient because the columns may still be
identified using the same identification index no matter what columns
are hidden or showing.</P>

<P>Items are added to the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B> via
the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html#AddItem()">AddItem()</A></TT></B>
and related functions. Items are represented by the
<B><TT><A HREF="CLVListItem.html">CLVListItem</A></TT></B> class.
<B><TT><A HREF="CLVListItem.html">CLVListItem</A></TT></B> is derived
from BListItem, and is used in a similar manner.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Conditions of use"></A>Conditions of use and other legal
crap</H2>

<P><B><TT>Condition 1: </TT></B>If you use
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B> in a
project, let me know, I'm curious if people are getting good use of
this stuff.</P>

<P><B><TT>Condition 2:
<A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B> and
associated classes and source code are being made publicly available
and free to use in freeware and shareware products with a price under
$25 (I believe that shareware should be cheap). For overpriced
shareware (hehehe) or commercial products, please contact me to
negotiate a fee for use. After all, I did work hard on this class and
invested a lot of time into it. That being said, DON'T WORRY I don't
want much. It totally depends on the sort of project you're working
on and how much you expect to make off it. If someone makes money off
my work, I'd like to get at least a little something (I want to get
an intel system once BeOS for intel comes out, but I don't know how
I'm going to come up with the $1000 or so to get a basic system, much
less a nice dual-PII or something - yeah right, I wish :-).</P>

<P><B><TT>Condition 3:</TT></B> If it is used in a shareware or
commercial product, I get a free copy (if I find it really useful and
not too expensive, I'll still pay for it anyway).</P>

<P><B><TT>Condition 4:</TT></B> The source is made available so that
you can improve and extend it as you need. But please think about
whether your extension would add utility to the basic
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>. If
so, modify it. If not, then specialize it through inheritance. The
reason why I make this request is, if you come up with a cool
modification to
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>,
please let me know and let me have a look at the source code. If I
think others would like access to your modification, I'll probably
roll the modifications into
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B> and
release an updated version. In particular, archiving and
instantiation of
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B> and
the associated classes would be nice, but I personally am not using
that functionality in my "real" project that inspired
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>, and
I don't have time to work on the archiving stuff. My other project
(Scheduler) has been on hold for too long...</P>

<P><B><TT>Condition 5:</TT></B> Feel free to distribute the
<B><TT><A HREF="ColumnListView.html">ColumnListView</A></TT></B>
source, including modified versions, but keep this documentation with
it.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Revision history"></A>Revision history</H2>

<P>2.5: Enhanced CLVColumn to allow drawing of the column header to
be overridden.  Added optional automated string truncation of the
column header label.  Modified ColumnListView to make string
truncation even easier.  Created CLVEasyItem.</P>

<P>2.3: Bug fixes</P>

<P>2.2: Enhanced CLVListItem to facilitate string truncation</P>

<P>2.1: Bug fixes</P>

<P>2.0: Cleaned up the type casting to make the code more safe and
efficient.</P>

<P>1.8: A few minor, but nonetheless important, improvements.</P>

<P>1.7: Changed how Sorting() function works, added SetSorting()
function.</P>

<P>1.6: Reworked the way sorting works, allowing shift-selection of
multiple columns for sorting, no more semaphore-protected globals, no
more distintion between sorting and boolean grouping.</P>

<P>1.5: Fixed even MORE really embarrassing bugs!!!</P>

<P>1.4: Fixed some embarrassing bugs (crashing bugs that must've been
hidden by my sample and real project somehow...) Can someone throw me
a rope to climb out of this hole?</P>

<P>1.3: Made drawing of list items more efficient (made it check the
clipping region and only call DrawItemColumn if a given column
intersects the clipping region), fixed a few documentation errors.
</P>

<P>1.1: Fixed embarassing bugs, and misfeatures which snuck by.</P>

<P>1.0: Initial fully functional release</P>

<P>0.8: Linear ColumnListView working with items, but no hierarchical
ColumnListView</P>

<P>0.5: Very rough public demo: no items, etc.</P>
